# Art-Gallery-management-system
It was my course work for Software Architecture using 15 different design patterns to show how art gallery exhbits should be managed. 
In particular, this system should show the halls and their exhibits, information about them for the gallery visitors. It provides 
understandable interface for user (fro now it`s console) and represents main gallery processes.
In the future I plan to decrease the number of patterns used for flexibility of usage nd maintanance. And to create some swing interface at 
the least. Hope, that this project will grow into something useful :)
